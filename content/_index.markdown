# Election Blog

## _By: Rachael Dziaba_

This blog contains my forecasts for the 2024 US Presidential Election for the class Gov 1347 with Professor Ryan Enos. It will be updated weekly on Mondays.

All pages not under the root directory of the website are listed below. You can also visit the list page of a single section, e.g., [posts](/post/), or [notes](/note/). See the [About](/about/) page for information about the blog.
